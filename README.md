# Project Multiplayer
 It was a school project at first but I start to update it to look like a real project

 # How to launch the game:
 - First go to the bin file and double click on make -open
 - Then when you're in visual studio right click on the solution on the right named MultiplayerGame then go in the properties and in Configure Startups Projects select Current project
 - Go in the file main.h in the project Server and press CTRL + F5, then go in the file main.h in the project Client and do the same thing
 - Last in IP put 127.0.0.1, in Port put 54000, and put the name that you want. If you want more player, launch more client with CTRL + F5 in the project Client
